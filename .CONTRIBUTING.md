## Contribute Code to A-Frame
Check out the issues labeled help wanted (easy) or help wanted (hard) for good issues to tackle. Here's how to submit a pull request (PR):

* Have a GitHub account with SSH keys set up.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Clone your fork of the repository locally (i.e., git clone git@github.com:yourusername/pr-finder).
* Run npm install to get dependencies and npm start to serve the test examples.
* Create a branch to work in (i.e., git checkout -b mybranch).
* Make changes to your fork of the repository, commit them, and push them (i.e., git add -A . && git commit -m 'My Changes (fixes #1234)' && git push origin mybranch).
* If necessary, write unit tests (guide) and run with npm test.
* Submit a pull request to the master branch. If you head to the A-Frame repository after running git push from earlier, you should see a pop up to submit a * pull request.
* Address review comments if any.
* As per usual with open source, you would agree to license your contributions under the MIT License.
